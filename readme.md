Project Title: Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histology Images

Project Description:
    Breast cancer grading plays an important role in predicting the aggressiveness of the disease. A key component in breast cancer grading is mitosis count (quantifying the number of cells in the process of diving at a given time). Currently, pathologists in the labs manually detect and count mitosis.

    The goal of this project  is to bring the power of machine learning to the field of pathology and provide a consistent tool and diagnostic aid that relieves pathologists of this tedious task. In this project, I leverage digital pathology images and convolutional neural networks to learn features of cells undergoing mitosis and detect them. The unique feature of this approach is that it detects mitosis cells and non-mitosis cells that might not be distinguishable to the human eye.
